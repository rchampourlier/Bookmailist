# Your bookmailist

## Why?

Bookmailist allows you to simply have **a simple web page with a list of bookmarks** you feed **by sending emails containing links** to an email address of your choice.

## Requirements

Some place to serve this Sinatra application. Heroku should do the trick, or any cloud server you may have.

## Create a cloudmailing.com account

Goto [cloudmailin](http://cloudmailin.com) and signup, 

## Paranoid protection against spam

Your mailincloud address is private. You should create an email account you can forward to this address. To be sure you won't get spammed and unwanted list arrive in your bookmailist, you can set filters on incoming email to only accept emails coming from your own addresses. Just see with your email provider how to do this.
